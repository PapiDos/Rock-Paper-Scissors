# ✊🏻 Rock Paper Scissors 📃✂️

This is a rock paper scissors game made in javascript.

## Project Purpose

This JavaScript project demonstrates my initial JavaScript skills acquired through the Foundation course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## How to play the game

It's a human vs. computer game and it's the best of 5 rounds.

**Note**: This initial version of the game doesn't have a UI. The browser will show you a prompt where you will type your choice. To follow your score and the final results, make sure you open Chrome's console (Ctrl + Shift + J).

1. Enter your choice in the browser's prompt and click OK

2. Check Chrome's console to see who won the round.

3. Play 5 rounds and check results in Chrome's console to see who won the match.
